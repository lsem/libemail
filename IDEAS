A feature that we have some kind of formulas on the server which provide up to date information about different settings on different clients.
So we can somehow make experience better for things like that:

server with bugs:

# Non functional feature: count all received and sent bytes on socket, estimate connection quality.
This would be just nice weature which gives an idea why network manager is not working if the problem is internet connection. We can immidiately spot that rate is low (e.g. to have three categories: green, yellow and red).
The thing is that finished email product with all modern bells and whistles should never hang
and be able to restore connection as soon as traffic is unblocked. E.g. the ultinate test would be to enter a lift
while data is send/received and see that we detected problems, communicated them to user nicely and as soon as wifi
is avaialble again, continuted transfer and connection health became green. Or dynamic network switching between networks to ensure that socket wotks as expected even though underlying connection has changed.

# Non functional feature: measure how fast parsing of responses is. Profiling.

# Is there something very minimal in terms of scripting that some user may benefit from? E.g. what if the client can be run as a script to do some work like downloading all emails? Isn't that is cool? Or we can have some scripts that allow use to automate they work. There could be a number of programmers that would buy the program if this fature is availalble.


# EmailClient that allows to transfer emails from one server to another.


# I want to have different notification policies on each folder or subfolder.
I want to select from old fashioned context menu settings for notifications for given folder.
E.g. for a folder with gerrit reviews I mostly want to ignore new emails there.
But for emails within folder MANAGEMENT I want to have SLA that if I'm not read an email in some time,
I would like to have HARSH notifications, like in MacDonalds.

It should help me to work in entreprise environment. As it should help Velera work in startup.


# The app communocates to more advanced users what is going on. E.g. server connections status,
internet reachability, amount of data downloaded, data location, current mode (idle or updating data), number of bytes, downloading data on mettered connection, etc..

# Downloading data on meterred connection
If we have meterred connection, we still may want to use the client. What if we have a mode that allows to download last N emails (say 100) but not download everhything.

# Plain old Tree where all inboxes are standard without tree?
